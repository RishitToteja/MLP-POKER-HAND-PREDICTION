# MLP-POKER-HAND-PREDICTION
descriptionIn this project, worked on a Neural Network model to predict any Poker Hand based on some set of given features . For Data Visualization as well as Model Evaluation, visual diagnostic tools from Yellowbrick were used. The training dataset for the model, was taken from "Carleton University, Department of Computer Science".
Since the dataset had class imbalance, it was first pre-processed before training. Thus upsampling from minority class was performed on the data
A Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network was trained with 3 hidden layers having 50, 100 and 50 neurons respectively and learning rate set as 'adaptive'.
The results of the model were:
1) Training Data : 77.42%
2) Test Data : 77.31%
